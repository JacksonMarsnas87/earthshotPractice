            summary: "Among more impoverished parts of the country and those who work in poor conditions, the cancer rate is almost 40% above the global average. This is no statistical anomaly. Thousands are dying every year as a result. However, most of these deaths are preventable by improving work conditions and making medical treatments more accessible for the less fortunate.",

The likely cause for many cancer cases is industry and the improper handling of waste and chemicals, as detailed above. Notably, villages that are nearby mining facilities have drastically higher rates of disease. Not only do they have higher cancer rates, but other complications such as birth defects as well. The graph below shows the relation between proximity with a mining facility and the average rate of cancer per 1000 people.",
                closingPoint: "The solution of this problem would result in a much lower mortality rate due to cancer in impoverished areas. Not only that, but it would force industry safety standards, particularly in concern with chemical misuse, to become more strict. With better standards and lower mortality rate, the members of impoverished groups will be able to contribute more and grow their own local economies."

Newer safety technology and safer mining methods exist as alternatives for industries to use.

Healthier people would result in a healthier, more robust workforce, and more people who can contribute to the local economy, improving impoverished communities as a whole."
